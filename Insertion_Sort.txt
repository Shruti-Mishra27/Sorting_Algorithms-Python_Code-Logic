4. Insertion Sort
a) Includes Shifting of elements in an array. 
b) For sorting "n" number of elements, we have to do "n-1" number of paases.
c) First we consider first element to be sorted and rest part to be unsorted.
d) Now we select first element of unsorted array and compare it with the sorted part(here element).
e) If sorted part is greater than the element, we insert the element in correct index(shift it).
f) If not, then nothing happens.
h) Then take next element in unsorted part and compare it with sorted elements.
i) Repeat step e) to h) to get the whole array sorted.
